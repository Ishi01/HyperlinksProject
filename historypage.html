            <h2 id="historyInto">Early Conceptualisation and Creation</h2>
            <p>
              &emsp;The origins and conceptualisation of hyperlinks, and by extension the internet can be traced back to as early as 1945, in an essay/short story entitled “As We May Think”, written by science fiction author Vannevar Bush. 
              Bush wrote about a so-called “memex” which would serve as a machine to index, contain and access all available human knowledge and research, in a manner which is easily accessible, writing of concepts such as: "Wholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear, ready-made with a mesh of associative trails running through them, ready to be dropped into the memex and there amplified.". 
              This bears a startling resemblance to some portions of the modern internet, in particular the use of hyperlinks to create a “mesh of associative trails”.
              <br>
              <br>
              &emsp;One of the pioneers of the early internet, Doug Engelbart, came across this essay relatively early in his career and, likely inspired by some of the contents within it, would go on to pioneer several transformative technologies which still underpin the modern internet, in addition to several other technical advances and concepts. 
              Notably, he was a member of the team at the Augmentation Research Lab in SRI International whichfirst developed both Hypertext and networked computers, essentially components of the modern internet and the first appearance of hyperlinks in their most basic form.
              <br>
              <br>
              &emsp;Notably, it was not Doug Engelbart who initially coined the term hypertext, and by extension the hyper prefix. Rather, it was an engineer named Ted Nelson (also likely inspired by “As We May Think”) who officially used those terms to describe a system created using linked content. 
              After this first use of the prefix “hyper” to describe this type of information storage and linking system, it has become standard nomenclature for the vast majority of linked content structures, most notably in this instance to the term “hyperlink”, also coined by Ted Nelson. 
              Though Ted Nelson was the one who initially coined the term, Doug Englebart gave the first full demonstration of technology using linked content, as well as many other technologies still reflected in modern computer infrastructure, at the so called “Mother of All Demos” in 1968.

              <p>
              &emsp;The next major evolution of hyperlinks came when Tim Berners-Lee invented the Internet, and by extension the World Wide Web over the course of 1989. 
              In this, he pioneered the use of HTTP (Hypertext Transmission Protocol) to transmit documents between computers using the Internet, a technology which still forms the basis of the vast majority of web communication today. 
              Additionally, he developed the first web browser and web server, as well as wrote the very basics of HTML, the language still used to format and design websites.
              In doing this, he solidified the use of hyperlinks as a core component of the internet. 
              <br>
              <br>
	            &emsp;The early forms of the internet relied heavily on hyperlinks in order to enable navigation, and as a result one of the early features implemented in HTML was the anchor tag, &lta&gt, in order to facilitate the inclusions of links in early web pages. 
              This has stayed consistent from the very earliest days of the internet up until now, due in no small part to Tim Berners-Lees, and others, efforts to encourage standardization across the infrastructure of the World Wide Web.
              In particular, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) took considerable steps to ensure that the operation of hyperlinks remained standardised across as much of the web as possible, to ensure interoperability and ease of navigation across the web.

            <h2 id="evolution">Evolution of Hyperlinks</h2>
            <p>
              &emsp;In the years since their development and standardisation as the primary way to navigate the Web, hyperlinks have undergone myriad evolutions and variations, in order to keep up to date with the sheer speed at which the internet has developed and changed. 
              One example of this is the concept of a dynamic hyperlink, which is generated or changed on the fly based on changing information or user input.
              For an example of a dynamic hyperlink, see the demonstration below.
            </p>
            <!-- Dynamic hyperlinks example, using a link which adjusts its endpoint depending on the selected radio button-->
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-center" style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;">
              <a class="nav-link active py-0" href="#" id="dynamicLinkEx" onclick="dynamicLinkExample()">Click here to see a Dynamic Hyperlink in action!</a>
            </div>
            
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
              <div class="form-check">
                <!--Option 1-->
                <input class="form-check-input" type="radio" name="flexRadioLink" id="linkOption1">
                <label class="form-check-label" for="linkOption1" style="margin-right: 15px;">
                  Take me to the Concept Page
                </label>
              </div>
              <!--Option 2-->
              <div class="form-check">
                <input class="form-check-input" type="radio" name="flexRadioLink" id="linkOption2">
                <label class="form-check-label" for="linkOption2">
                  Take me to the About the Author Page
                </label>
              </div>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>
              &emsp;Some further examples of newer types of hyperlinks include social media hyperlinks, which are designed to allow users to navigate directly to different parts of a social media platform from outside of it with a single link. 
              In this same vein, deep mobile hyperlinks are used to navigate directly to internal parts of a mobile app, while bypassing the home screen of said application entirely. 
              Furthermore, a combination of dynamic and mobile deep hyperlinks allows the creation of Cross Platform or “Universal” hyperlinks, which adjust based on the operating system currently being used to send users to a specific part of that OS’s version of different applications. 
              These are only a couple of examples of the many different types, as well as newer underlying technologies, that have been created in the last decade.
              <br>
              <br>
	            &emsp;It is only natural that, given how important hyperlinks are to the function of the internet, they would evolve alongside it, taking on new forms and functions as demanded by its rapid growth and evolution. 
              The examples above are proof enough of this, and the fact that the internet, and by extension hyperlinks themselves, still function reasonably well is a testament to just how critical a component they have become in the infrastructure of the World Wide Web.
